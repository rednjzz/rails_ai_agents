# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sdd:plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Ruby 3.3.6, Rails 8.1.3
**Primary Dependencies**: Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus), ImportMap, Propshaft, SQLite3
**Storage**: SQLite3 (primary, cache via Solid Cache, queue via Solid Queue, cable via Solid Cable)
**Testing**: Minitest (unit/integration), Capybara + Selenium (system tests)
**Target Platform**: Web application, single server (Kamal/Docker deployment)
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: [feature-specific, e.g., page loads <1s, form submission <X seconds or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: [feature-specific, e.g., concurrent-request safety, booking horizon or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale/Scope**: [feature-specific, e.g., single tenant, expected traffic level or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]

**Structure Decision**: Standard Rails MVC layout. [Document namespace strategy
(e.g., Admin:: for staff routes) and any non-standard directories added.]

## Hotwire Decision Matrix

| User Interaction | Technique | Rationale |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| [e.g., Page navigation] | Turbo Drive | [Full page replacement, no custom JS needed] |
| [e.g., Inline edit form] | Turbo Frame | [Lazy-loaded partial update within a frame] |
| [e.g., Real-time list update] | Turbo Stream | [Server-pushed append/replace/remove] |
| [e.g., Date picker validation] | Stimulus | [Client-side behavior on a specific element] |

<!--
  Fill one row per distinct UI interaction in the feature.
  Default to Turbo Drive unless a specific interaction needs frames, streams, or JS.
  Rationale column prevents over-engineering with Stimulus where Turbo suffices.
-->

## Migration Safety

- [ ] All migrations are reversible (use `change` method or paired `up`/`down`)
- [ ] No mixed DDL and data manipulation in the same migration
- [ ] Large-table indexes use `disable_ddl_transaction!` + `algorithm: :concurrently` (PostgreSQL) or are verified safe for SQLite3
- [ ] Foreign key constraints include appropriate `on_delete` behavior
- [ ] Migration order matches model dependency graph

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
