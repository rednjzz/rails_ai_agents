| `mailers.md` | `app/mailers/**`, `spec/mailers/**` |
| `migrations.md` | `db/migrate/**`, `db/schema.rb` |
| `views.md` | `app/views/**`, `app/components/**`, `app/presenters/**` |
| `testing.md` | `spec/**` |
| `principles.md` | `app/**/*.rb` |

### Hooks (`.claude/settings.json`)

| Hook | Event | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **SessionStart** | Session begins | Injects project context (branch, Ruby/Rails version, pending migrations) |
| **PostToolUse** | After Edit/Write | Auto-formats Ruby files with RuboCop |
| **PreToolUse** | Before Bash | Blocks destructive commands (rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force push to main) |
| **TaskCompleted** | Task marked done | Quality gate: reminds to run tests and linting |
| **Stop** | Response ends | Desktop notification |

### Settings

- **Agent Teams** enabled (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`)
- **JSON Schema** for editor autocomplete
- **Smart model routing**: opus for architecture/security, sonnet for coding, haiku for linting

## Spec Driven Development (SDD) Kit

A structured specification-to-implementation pipeline powered by 8 slash commands. SDD enforces a disciplined workflow: define what you're building before writing code, validate requirements quality, then implement from a task plan.
Based on Github Spec-kit

### SDD Commands (`.claude/commands/sdd/`)

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/sdd:constitution` | Create or update the project constitution — core principles and governance rules |
| `/sdd:specify` | Generate a feature specification from a natural language description |
| `/sdd:clarify` | Ask up to 5 targeted questions to reduce ambiguity in the spec |
| `/sdd:checklist` | Generate a requirements quality checklist |
| `/sdd:plan` | Create a technical implementation plan with research, data model, and contracts |
| `/sdd:tasks` | Break the plan into dependency-ordered, executable tasks organized by user story |
| `/sdd:analyze` | Read-only consistency analysis across spec, plan, and tasks |
| `/sdd:implement` | Execute the task plan phase-by-phase with progress tracking |

### SDD Workflow

```
/sdd:constitution                  # 1. Define project principles (once)
/sdd:specify user authentication   # 2. Write the feature spec
/sdd:clarify                       # 3. Resolve ambiguities (optional)
/sdd:checklist security            # 4. Validate requirements quality (optional)
/sdd:plan                          # 5. Generate technical plan + data model
/sdd:tasks                         # 6. Break into ordered tasks
/sdd:analyze                       # 7. Cross-artifact consistency check
/sdd:implement                     # 8. Execute tasks with verification
```

Each command hands off to the next via suggested prompts. The pipeline creates a `specs/<branch-name>/` directory with all artifacts:

```
specs/001-user-auth/
├── spec.md           # Feature specification (/sdd:specify)
├── plan.md           # Implementation plan (/sdd:plan)
├── research.md       # Technical research & decisions (/sdd:plan)
├── data-model.md     # Entity definitions (/sdd:plan)
├── quickstart.md     # Integration scenarios (/sdd:plan)
├── contracts/        # Route and API contracts (/sdd:plan)
├── tasks.md          # Executable task list (/sdd:tasks)
└── checklists/       # Requirements quality checklists (/sdd:checklist)
```

### SDD Infrastructure (`.specify/`)

The `.specify/` directory contains the scaffolding that powers SDD commands:

- **`templates/`** — Markdown templates for specs, plans, tasks, checklists, constitutions, and agent context files
- **`scripts/bash/`** — Shell scripts for branch creation, prerequisite checking, plan setup, and agent context updates
- **`memory/`** — Persistent project state (constitution, decisions)
- **`init-options.json`** — Configuration (branch numbering mode, AI agent type)

SDD supports extensibility via `.specify/extensions.yml` for before/after hooks on any command, template overrides in `.specify/templates/overrides/`, and presets in `.specify/presets/`.

### Key SDD Concepts

- **Constitution** — Non-negotiable project principles validated at every planning gate
- **Specs are stakeholder-facing** — No implementation details; focus on WHAT and WHY
- **Checklists are "unit tests for English"** — They validate requirements quality, not implementation correctness
- **Tasks organized by user story** — Each story is independently implementable and testable (MVP-first)

## Extensibility Guide

The [Claude Code Extensibility Guide](docs/claude-code-extensibility-guide.md) covers all extension mechanisms: CLAUDE.md, skills, hooks, subagents, Agent Teams, MCP servers, and plugins. Includes decision trees, configuration references, community patterns, and an adoption playbook.
