- **Smart model routing**: opus for architecture/security, sonnet for coding, haiku for linting

## Spec Driven Development (SDD) Kit

A structured specification-to-implementation pipeline powered by 11 slash commands. SDD enforces a disciplined workflow: define what you're building before writing code, validate requirements quality, then implement from a task plan.

### SDD Commands (`.claude/commands/sdd/`)

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/sdd:constitution` | Create or update the project constitution — core principles and governance rules |
| `/sdd:specify` | Generate a feature specification from a natural language description |
| `/sdd:clarify` | Ask up to 5 targeted questions to reduce ambiguity in the spec |
| `/sdd:spec-review` | Adversarial review of the spec from security, performance, edge-case, scalability, and compliance perspectives |
| `/sdd:checklist` | Generate a requirements quality checklist |
| `/sdd:plan` | Create a technical implementation plan with research, data model, and contracts |
| `/sdd:tasks` | Break the plan into dependency-ordered, executable tasks organized by user story |
| `/sdd:analyze` | Read-only consistency analysis across spec, plan, and tasks |
| `/sdd:implement` | Execute the task plan phase-by-phase with progress tracking |
| `/sdd:implement-subagents` | Same as implement, but spawns a fresh-context subagent per task to prevent context rot on large features |
| `/sdd:validate` | Post-implementation drift detection — verifies code implements what the spec promises (4-layer hybrid, no annotations needed) |

### SDD Workflow

```
/sdd:constitution                  # 1. Define project principles (once)
/sdd:specify user authentication   # 2. Write the feature spec
/sdd:clarify                       # 3. Resolve ambiguities (optional)
/sdd:spec-review                   # 4. Adversarial review from 5 perspectives (optional)
/sdd:checklist security            # 5. Validate requirements quality (optional)
/sdd:plan                          # 6. Generate technical plan + data model
/sdd:tasks                         # 7. Break into ordered tasks
/sdd:analyze                       # 8. Cross-artifact consistency check
/sdd:implement                     # 9. Execute tasks with verification
# Or for large features:
/sdd:implement-subagents           # 9. Fresh-context subagent per task (prevents context rot)
/sdd:validate                      # 10. Verify implementation matches spec (post-implementation)
```

Each command hands off to the next via suggested prompts. The pipeline creates a `specs/<branch-name>/` directory with all artifacts:

```
specs/001-user-auth/
├── spec.md           # Feature specification (/sdd:specify)
├── plan.md           # Implementation plan (/sdd:plan)
├── research.md       # Technical research & decisions (/sdd:plan)
├── data-model.md     # Entity definitions (/sdd:plan)
├── quickstart.md     # Integration scenarios (/sdd:plan)
├── contracts/        # Route and API contracts (/sdd:plan)
├── tasks.md          # Executable task list (/sdd:tasks)
├── checklists/       # Requirements quality checklists (/sdd:checklist)
└── validation-report.md  # Post-implementation drift report (/sdd:validate)
```

### SDD Infrastructure (`.specify/`)

The `.specify/` directory contains the scaffolding that powers SDD commands:

- **`templates/`** — Markdown templates for specs, plans, tasks, checklists, constitutions, and agent context files
- **`scripts/bash/`** — Shell scripts for branch creation, prerequisite checking, plan setup, and agent context updates
- **`memory/`** — Persistent project state (constitution, lessons learned across features)
- **`init-options.json`** — Configuration (branch numbering mode, AI agent type)

SDD supports extensibility via `.specify/extensions.yml` for before/after hooks on any command, template overrides in `.specify/templates/overrides/`, and presets in `.specify/presets/`.

### Key SDD Concepts

- **Constitution** — Non-negotiable project principles validated at every planning gate
- **Lessons Learned** — Cross-feature learnings accumulate in `.specify/memory/lessons-learned.md` and feed into future planning and implementation
- **Adversarial Spec Review** — `/sdd:spec-review` challenges the spec from security, performance, edge-case, scalability, and compliance perspectives before planning begins
- **Specs are stakeholder-facing** — No implementation details; focus on WHAT and WHY
- **Checklists are "unit tests for English"** — They validate requirements quality, not implementation correctness
- **Tasks organized by user story** — Each story is independently implementable and testable (MVP-first)
- **Fresh-context implementation** — `/sdd:implement-subagents` spawns a clean subagent per task, preventing context rot on large features
- **Post-implementation validation** — `/sdd:validate` uses a 4-layer hybrid approach (structural scan, test mapping, AI semantic analysis, acceptance test generation) to verify the code matches the spec — works on day one, no code annotations needed

### SDD Small-Change (Lightweight Mode)

For bug fixes and small features that don't need the full SDD ceremony. Three commands, no plan, no checklists, no analysis — just specify, task, implement.

#### Commands (`.claude/commands/sdd-change/`)

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/sdd-change:specify` | Create a minimal change spec (problem, fix, acceptance criteria, files affected) |
| `/sdd-change:tasks` | Generate a flat 3-8 task list from the change spec |
| `/sdd-change:implement` | Execute tasks sequentially with validation |

#### Workflow

```
/sdd-change:specify Fix login timeout — sessions expire after 5min instead of 30
/sdd-change:tasks
/sdd-change:implement
```

#### When to Use Which

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Bug fix, patch, tweak | `/sdd-change:specify` |
| New feature, multi-story epic | `/sdd:specify` |
| Refactor touching 1-3 files | `/sdd-change:specify` |
| Refactor touching 6+ files | `/sdd:specify` |

The lightweight pipeline warns you if your change looks too complex (>3 acceptance criteria or >6 files affected) and suggests switching to the full pipeline.

## MCP Servers (`mcp/`)

Custom MCP servers that extend Claude Code with external integrations.

| Server | Purpose | Docs |
|--------|---------|------|
| [`sentry_monitor`](mcp/sentry_monitor/) | Exposes Sentry production errors as Claude Code tools — query issues, map stack traces to local files, detect new errors with persistent state tracking, PII redaction by default | [README](mcp/sentry_monitor/README.md) |
